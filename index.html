    <h1>Arduino Traffic Light Project</h1>
    <p>This project utilizes an Arduino board to create a dynamic traffic light system. The traffic light sequentially displays red, yellow, and green lights, mimicking real-world traffic signals to manage vehicular flow. Each color is programmed to illuminate for specific durations, ensuring safe transitions between stopping and going. The Arduino board's specifications allow for precise control over the light sequences, making it an ideal platform for demonstrating traffic management concepts. This project not only showcases the basic principles of electronics and programming but also emphasizes the importance of traffic signals in ensuring road safety.</p>
